## Day 25 Project
Today I created a turtle graphics game which you guess an U.S State. You type 'exit' to end the game and it tells you which states name you should learn.

## Day 25 Progress
Today I learned about how to handle .csv (Comma Seperated Values) files with python, introduction to pandas package. I also combined my turtle knowledge with information I learned today.

## Pandas
Learned the difference between DataFrame and Series and how to use their functions. How to create a DataFrame from scratch. Converting DataFrames to csv files.

## 02.04.2023 Update
After learning about list comprehension method I upgraded my 'states to learn' list in a better way.
